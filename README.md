# Cross Country Run Planner

### Overview

This application enables you to plan your cross country run and download it as GPX file.

[Cross country running](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_country_running) is a sport in which teams and individuals run a race on open-air courses over natural terrain such as dirt or grass.

The application is deployed on [Heroku](https://obscure-hollows-42504.herokuapp.com).

### Tech Stack

- `React`
- `Redux`
- `Webpack`
- `SASS`

### Requirements

Users can plan their favorite route across fields and hills by just placing markers as waypoints on the map. For detailed planning the same waypoints show up as a list where users can delete and rearrange them until the route is perfect and ready to download.

The User Interface should be based on the following design.
